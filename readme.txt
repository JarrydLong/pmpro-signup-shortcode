Add a shortcode [pmpro_signup] that can be used to embed a sign up form for free Paid Memberships Pro levels.

Note: This replaces similar functionality that used to be included in the PMPro Register Helper addon.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-signup-shortcode` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
